# Artist-Classification
Artistic Style Classification with Neural Networks

Can neural networks appreciate art? ðŸŽ¨ In this project, we explore how well neural networks can develop an understanding of artistic styles. By working on this project, you'll gain insights into implementing **transfer learning** and **image data augmentation**, and analyze their impact on model performance.

We will work with a dataset comprising several hundred paintings by world-famous artists. The goal is to train a deep learning model that, like an art expert, can predict the painter of an unknown artwork with high accuracy.
